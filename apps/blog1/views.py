""" ğŸ’¡ You just created your first Django view.
    ğŸ’¡ The post_list view takes the request object as the only parameter.
        This parameter is required by all views.

    ğŸ‘€ğŸ‘€ğŸ’¡ In this view, you retrieve all the posts with the published status using the published manager that you created previously.

    ğŸ‘€ğŸ‘€ğŸ’¡ Finally, you use the render() shortcut provided by Django to render the list of posts with the given template.
    This function takes the request object, the template path, and the context variables to render the given template.

    It returns an HttpResponse object with the rendered text (normally HTML code). 

    The render() shortcut takes the request context into account, so any variable set by the template context processors is accessible by the given template.

    Template context processors are just callables that set variables into the context.

    ğŸ‘€ This view takes the year, month, day, and post arguments to retrieve a published post with the given slug and date.

    ğŸ‘€ Note that when you created the Post model, you added the unique_for_date parameter to the slug field.
    ğŸ‘€ This ensures that there will be only one post with a slug for a given date, and thus, you can retrieve single posts using the date and slug.

    ğŸ‘€ Finally, you use the render() shortcut to render the retrieved post using a template.
